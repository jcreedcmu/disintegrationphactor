A
Started sometime around late second semester of 1998-9 academic year
A
"marvin" (2:13)
-
First attempt at song-length techno.
Very drum-heavy, discontinuous sound.
Reasonably satisfied with it, considering
it is a first try.
A
"toaster OS" (3:20)
-
A nice conservative I-V-bVII-IV progression,
with a faded sudden dropoff in the middle
and some melodic cruft thereafter.
I think it achieves a reasonably sufficient
density, and aside from some audible clicks
(technical difficulties, ugh) and the monotonic
timbre of the instruments, it's decent.
A
"jargon" (2:48)
-
Experimentation with continuous (or nearly so)
timbre changes. Going for a more
traditional techno-ish sound. 
A
5/22/1999-7/10/1999
"flat nine" (3:40)
-
Nifty syncopated bass line on A minor, nominally.
Research in cymbal-like sounds.
(There is no significant flat nine, musically ---
I just like the name. The most interesting
interval, in fact, is probably the tritone between
the A and Eb in the bass line)
A
7/11/1999
"helvetia" (6:48)
-
Really simple classical sounding stuff,
repeated 17 times, with melodic and timbral
variations. Definitely the least hack/sound
time ratio so far. (about 30)
A
7/14/1999-7/18/1999
"a priori synthetic" (3:39)
-
Have been working on this on piano
for quite some time now. Main theme
is alternation beteen Cmaj7 and Db6/9,
with some funky altered shit in the
bridge. Oh, and there's the classical-ish
intro, too. Some development in percussion.
The programming style is somewhat more 
functional and parameterizable than usual.
A
7/19/1999-7/25/1999
"bend the rules" (1:19)
-
Have no idea how or why this turned out the
way it did. Not terribly satisfied with it,
but don't want to toss it out, either. Oh well.
A
7/24/1999-7/27/1999
"blue star" (3:41)
-
Altered blues progression (I-IV-I-I-IV-IV-I-VI-IIm-V-I-V)
in 5/4 time. Finally got a nice 'tick' sound, set
on the off beats against some cymbals. Lots of
changing harmonics and dynamics.
A
7/25/1999-7/26/1999
"social engineering" (5:48)
-
A two-measure 13/8 rythm grouped 7-7-7-5 that came
to me at about 0100.25.7. Inspiration part Brubeck,
part Schuresko. Wood-block like percussion in
addition to the usual bass, snare, and cymbal.
Coming close to piano-sounding stuff.
A
7/28/1999-8/01/1999
"what pipe?" (4:15)
-
Classical sound, but more interesting
than helevetia due to pseudo-canonic 
interleaving.
A
8/12/1999-
"depressingly stupid machine" (2:00)
-
Echoing timbre-changing octaves and
some simple percussion for an intro.
A number of layers of walking tritone-y
'chord progression' with a 8KHz 
pseudosnare almost-randomly dropping
out the melody in some places.

Total: 39:31
